                why build in public?
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                building in public makes you think clearer. like, when you know someone else might read about your process, you naturally get better at explaining your reasoning and documenting decisions
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
                it's less about perfection and more about making your thoughts make sense—both for yourself and others
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
                it's also like a personal progress tracker. looking back on old projects? instant reminder of how far you've come. and, bonus, your journey might help someone else who's just starting out
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                my first two projects
            </p>

            <p>
                i kicked things off with two simple apps that solved problems i'd actually run into:
            </p>

            <p>
                a wim hof breathing exercise app w cyberpunk theme
            </p>

            <p>
                a minimal pomodoro timer for focus
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                both incredibly simple, but they help me practice the fundamentals for tools i could use right away
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                looking forward?
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                i'm hyped to take on more complex projects and keep sharing along the way. building in public isn't just showing off—it's starting conversations with people on similar paths
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                and honestly, i can't wait to see where it all leads :)
