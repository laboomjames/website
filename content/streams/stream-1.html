                its meant to read more casually, like we're talking
            </p>

            <p>
                and honestly this is also an exercise for me to just write more and get it out without thinking too much about editing

                i also included a way to switch sides just by using blockquotes for the right side messages

                and in a way its a good method of self reflection bc i have to think about it from the perspective of the sender or the receiver

                i previously thought about a journaling app where the whole idea was looking like texts bc i do so much of my best thinking just texting people
            </blockquote>

            <blockquote>
                but at first it looked a little weird. we'll see if i keep it
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                switching back to the "other side" feels interesting and is definitely distinct from standard free form writing that might happen in a notes app or something. i like it
            </p>

                till next time :)
