                When I started the Build Your Own Apps course, I made a conscious decision to document my journey publicly. Here's why that matters and what I've learned so far.
            </p>

            <p>
                Learning to code is often portrayed as a solitary pursuit. But by building in public, you create opportunities for feedback, accountability, and unexpected connections.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Build in Public?</h2>
            
            <p>
                Building in public forces you to clarify your thinking. When you know others might read about your process, you naturally become more thoughtful about documenting decisions and explaining your reasoning.
            </p>

            <p>
                It also creates a valuable record of your progress. Looking back at earlier projects helps you appreciate how far you've come, while potentially helping others who are just starting their journey.
            </p>

            <h2>My First Two Projects</h2>
            
            <p>
                I started with two applications that solved specific problems I encountered:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>A Cyberpunk-themed breathing exercise app</li>
                <li>A minimal Pomodoro timer for focused work sessions</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Each project taught me fundamental web development concepts while producing something immediately useful.
            </p>

            <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
            
            <p>
                As I continue this journey, I'm excited to tackle more complex projects and share what I learn along the way. Building in public isn't just about showing your work—it's about creating a dialogue with others who are on similar paths.
